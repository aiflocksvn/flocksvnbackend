The reality is that venture capital can hurt you as much as it helps you, and the check always comes with golden handcuffs. Emerging opportunities like StartEngine (c’mon you know we’re going there) provide new options for founders that need funding. Let’s break down the differences between equity crowdfunding and venture capital, so you can understand the unique advantages that raising from the crowd brings to the table.Deal Flow10,000 VC deals closed in the US in 2020 from over 1,300 VC firms. Considering there are 5M small businesses in the US, that means only a small fraction of businesses secure VC funding.On the other hand, there are 67 equity crowdfunding portals in the US, and in 2020, there were 1,119 offerings*,141 of which were launched on StartEngine. While the total number of crowdfunding campaigns is far lower than the number of VC investments, that is to be expected given that equity crowdfunding has only been around a few years compared to venture capital’s decades. As equity crowdfunding grows—and it’s growing quickly, StartEngine tripled its growth last year—we believe that gap will close in the coming years.*this equity crowdfunding data looks at just Regulation Crowdfunding offerings (pre-seed and seed rounds) and excludes Regulation A+ data (Series A and beyond).Selection ProcessVC funding is highly selective. VCs have indicated they receive about 1,000 proposals for every 3 or 4 companies they fund, and only 0.05% of companies raise venture capital.Equity crowdfunding has a selection process too. For example, at StartEngine, 1% of applicants launch on the platform. However, there is an important difference in these two selection processes that makes one more inclusive than the other.Equity crowdfunding exists entirely online. Entrepreneurs can apply to raise on StartEngine from anywhere around the country and raise capital from a crowd of hundreds of thousands of diverse investors.In venture capital, it’s often critical to be a part of an inner circle in order to get funding. Startups that reach VCs through warm introductions are 13 times more likely to be funded than those startups which came to the attention of the VC through a ‘cold’ pitch deck submission or email.However, those inner circles around venture capital are often homogenous. For example, 4% of VC partners are Black. As you can imagine, this creates issues with diversity. DiversityVC checks go to college-educated white men. Out of 9,987 funded founders in a study by RateMyInvestor and Diversity VC, only 9% were female, 17% identified as Asian-American, 2.4% as Middle Eastern, 1.9% as Latin American and just 1% identified as black.And it’s not just the diversity of the founders. It’s also an issue of geographic diversity. VC deals are geographically concentrated in three states: California, Massachusetts, and New York, which account for more than 73% of total capital invested in the US. What about businesses in the other 47 states?Equity crowdfunding levels that playing field. As of December 2020, 26.8% of offerings have had a female founder or co-founder (source: the StartEngine Index). Through the first 5 months of 2021, 33.3% of campaigns had a minority founder or cofounder, and 54% of capital comes from the top three states (California, New York, and Texas)—and for what it’s worth, California, New York, and Texas are also 3 of the 4 biggest states in the US by population size.There is more work to be done. Female and minority entrepreneurs are still underrepresented in equity crowdfunding, but in the first 5 years of its existence, equity crowdfunding is proving to be more diverse than venture capital.Deal TermsVCs control the terms of the funding round. They often demand preferred shares with significant liquidation preferences and board seats, and you will generally be required to issue a large percentage of equity (typically 20% to 25%).In many cases, this means that the VC controls the future of the company, and this can create serious friction between the VC and the founder. In fact, according to a Harvard study, 20-40% of founders do not remain in their original role through exit.In other words, VCs often kick the founder out of their own company to replace them with someone else they believe can better handle the business and their growth expectations.On equity crowdfunding platforms like StartEngine, the founder sets the terms of the raise, from the company’s valuation to the share price, and there is no risk that a controlling interest of investors can oust you from your own company or dilute your ownership in the business more than you are comfortable with.Notably, most companies on StartEngine choose to issue common stock, meaning the shareholders often own the same class of stock as the founders. Everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goal.Fundraising StrategyFounders have been trained to believe they should follow a certain fundraising progression. While we believe startups should “Always Be Raising”, they can still follow something similar to the “traditional” process with equity crowdfunding, as deal sizes tend to be comparable.The average VC seed round weighs in at about $2.2M, and the majority of Series A rounds raise less than $9M. These rounds can be replicated with equity crowdfunding, where companies raise pre-seed and/or seed rounds under Regulation Crowdfunding, which allows founders to raise up to $5M in a calendar year. Then they can follow that with a Regulation A+ campaign, which allows companies to raise up to $75M in a calendar year to cover their Series A, B, and beyond.Let’s Talk Pros and ConsVenture capital and equity crowdfunding each have some unique positives and drawbacks. Let’s explore them.Venture Capital ProsDeep pockets – With hundreds of millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars to deploy, VCs can offer startups a large amount of capital very quicklyExperience – As a more established form of capital investment, VCs have years of experience guiding high-growth companiesNetwork – VCs often have access to strategic connections and valuable resourcesValidation – companies that secure capital from a reputable firm can gain credibility and prestigeVenture Capital ConsExclusivity – Less than 1% of companies get VC funding, and it can be hard to break into VC’s inner circleValuation – VCs can put significant downward pressure on startup valuations to increase their upsideControl – VCs often seek advantageous terms (like board seats, preferred shares and anti-dilution protections, among others) to gain control at the expense of founders, which can lead to scenarios where the founders are forced out against their willPressure – In order to generate a quick exit scenario that will bring returns to their portfolio, VCs push startups to grow at unsustainable and unhealthy levels Equity Crowdfunding ProsControl – Companies usually offer non-voting, common shares via equity crowdfunding, allowing founders to maintain control of the companyBrand Ambassadors – Equity crowdfunding allows startups to build armies of hundreds (if not thousands) of investors, who then become customers and brand championsExposure – By marketing their equity crowdfunding campaigns, companies reach new audiencesSales – Companies can increase sales by offering investment perks like discounts related to their core businessSteady Capital – Equity crowdfunding allows companies to always be raising, rather than raising capital in fits and startsEquity Crowdfunding ConsNo Guarantees – There is no certainty a company will meet its equity crowdfunding goalDisclosures – Because equity crowdfunding offerings are open to the public, companies must be transparent with financials and reportingCosts – There are legal, accounting, platform and marketing costs associated with equity crowdfunding campaignsConclusion51% of companies that raise money on StartEngine return to raise another round of capital on the platform, which speaks volumes to the power and control entrepreneurs find in equity crowdfunding.

First off, I want to wish you a happy Earth Day. This is the 52nd year this important holiday has been celebrated across the globe… and this year’s theme, “Invest in the Planet,” couldn’t be more timely.Now, it goes without saying that as a member of the Republic community, a focus on investing is guaranteed to pique my interest (especially investing in projects working to solve the world’s biggest problems–climate change included).But as a crypto evangelist, I’m especially excited to dig into one of the most common concerns I hear about crypto: its environmental impact. For years now, critics have argued that the cryptocurrency industry is a scourge to the environment, mainly due to the high volume of electricity used by mining systems.To those people, I say: it’s time to take a closer look. Yes, huge Bitcoin mining operations require lots of power… but if you look at the crypto industry as a whole, you’ll see a very different picture. For the most part, crypto is actually a force for good when it comes to sustainability, as it reinforces economic alignment to cheaper energy sources (i.e., renewables). I’ll explain what I mean by that in this article–but first, let’s examine crypto’s (unfairly) bad rep and how that myth made it to the mainstream.Let’s set the record straight…Crypto is not inherently bad for the planetA few years ago, new data from the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index emerged with one shocking takeaway: in 2019, Bitcoin mining used the same amount of electricity as some small countries (think Sweden or Finland).While this is technically true–Bitcoin as an industry uses roughly half a percent of global energy production each year–there are several reasons this stat is not the smoking gun most people think it is.First of all, it’s important to note that using energy is not the same thing as having high carbon emissions. That’s why massive industries that use tons of power can still be carbon-neutral, depending on their practices.It’s remarkably tough to nail down the exact level of emissions created by Bitcoin mining each year, but consider this: Any time energy is transported to its end users, some of it is lost along the way. Bitcoin can be mined from anywhere in the world–which means mining rigs can be set up right next to unique energy sources like hydroelectric dams, wind farms, and even volcanoes.To tap into those alternative energy sources, we’re seeing a new trend emerge: modular Bitcoin mining rigs built into shipping containers. These ultra-streamlined units can be sent to remote locations with large natural energy sources, which are often unused or underutilized due to their distance from end users. These onsite mining rigs eliminate that problem.By using such a broad mix of energy sources, Bitcoin mining actually does a pretty decent job of reducing carbon emissions. In their 2020 study, the CCAF estimated that about 39% of Bitcoin’s total energy consumption was carbon-neutral. (That’s about 2X better than the United States’ overall consumption.)I believe that number will continue to increase over the next few years–and to understand why, you need to look at the way Bitcoin is designed at its core.Bitcoin is built to be hyper-competitiveA few years ago, you could make decent money mining Bitcoin in your own home with a relatively modest setup. It’s much harder now (hence the shipping container rigs). We don’t need to get too technical here, but essentially, the math problems mining machines need to solve become more complex over time (and will continue to do so).This framework is called “proof of work.” It basically means that in order to create and sustain Bitcoin, you need to prove that your machines are doing a great deal of complicated computing. As that landscape becomes more competitive, proof of work will always require more energy to use.That poses an obvious problem for Bitcoin miners: fossil fuels are expensive. Renewables, like solar, wind, and hydro, are much cheaper–and their costs are falling across the board each year. Thus, Bitcoin actually has an incredibly clear incentive to move towards greener energy. Long tail, I would say that Bitcoin will actually be a driver for the financialization of greentech. The green stuff is the cheap stuff.Plus, Bitcoin is just one of the thousands of cryptocurrencies out there today–and it’s the only one that really needs to use the proof of work mechanism. There’s a better way emerging, and it’s about to get a huge boost.Proof of stake: a better way forwardUnlike proof of work, a proof of stake system doesn’t reward users for using more computational power. Rather, proof of stake requires participants to “stake” a portion of their own crypto (almost like collateral) to earn a chance to contribute to the blockchain and earn a reward.From a sustainability perspective, the benefits are clear–proof of stake isn’t a contest to build the biggest mining rig or chew up the most energy crunching numbers. Researchers estimate that proof of stake systems use 99.99% less energy than proof of work. It’s also a better way to reward high-quality contributors and cull bad actors.Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin, has been working towards making the switch from proof of work to proof of stake since its inception in 2015. That change is expected to finally happen by the end of Q2 this year–and it’s the talk of the town in the industry.Nearly every other crypto is following suit, except Bitcoin–and if you ask me, that’s the way it should be. Bitcoin is really the only blockchain that needs to stay on proof of work. There are many reasons for this, but simply put, Bitcoin is just too large and established to switch over now; doing so would throw the whole system into chaos.That’s not the case for the roughly 18,000 other cryptocurrencies in circulation. My “hot take” is that every single one should move to proof of stake, or another novel, green consensus mechanism, if they haven’t already. I see a future where Bitcoin mining (and, frankly, the rest of the world) has moved to renewable energy sources; the rest of the blockchains use proof of stake protocols; and the world’s toughest problems, like climate change, are solved by cutting-edge crypto projects that can help offset carbon emissions, reforest the planet, and optimize the global energy supply.Republic is building that futureWe’re incredibly lucky here to be working with many crypto projects pursuing that same vision. To celebrate Earth Day, we’re going live in just a few hours with an exciting forum alongside representatives from six of the industry’s leading projects tackling climate change.It’s all happening at 1:00pm ET. Just click here to sign up.We’re also working on a special new podcast episode featuring the founder of Nori, a blockchain-based marketplace that aims to reverse climate change by actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In other words, they’re actually fixing some of the damage already done, rather than just reducing future pollution.Source: Nori.comIt’s a radical (and critical) mission that exemplifies that future vision I was talking about. Not only does it take climate change mitigation to the next level… it’s also incredibly transparent. Any time Nori removes carbon from the atmosphere, that claim is verified by third-party auditors, and their registry is posted in plain sight.We’ll let you know when that episode goes live–you won’t want to miss it.Let me know in the comments below if you want to hear about the other exciting crypto projects I’ve worked with in this space. If I see enough interest, I’ll come back with a “part two.” (Believe me–I could talk about these projects all day.)That’s all for now.

That’s why massive industries that use tons of power can still be carbon-neutral, depending on their practices.</p><p>It’s remarkably tough to nail down the exact level of emissions created by Bitcoin mining each year, but consider this: Any time energy is transported to its end users, some of it is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://insideenergy.org/2015/11/06/lost-in-transmission-how-much-electricity-disappears-between-a-power-plant-and-your-plug/\" id=\"external-text-link-3\">lost</a><span>&nbsp;</span>along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin can be mined from anywhere in the world–which means mining rigs can be set up right next to unique energy sources like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/costa-rica-hydro-plant-gets-new-lease-life-crypto-mining-2022-01-11/\" id=\"external-text-link-4\">hydroelectric dams</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://etb.lv/\" id=\"external-text-link-5\">wind farms</a>, and even<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-59368483#:~:text=El%20Salvador%20plans%20to%20build,Uni%C3%B3n%2C%20President%20Nayib%20Bukele%20said.\" id=\"external-text-link-6\">volcanoes</a>.</p><p>To tap into those alternative energy sources, we’re seeing a new<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2022/03/25/crypto-miners-use-natural-gas-stranded-in-wells-to-power-energy-hungry-rigs/\" id=\"external-text-link-7\">trend</a><span>&nbsp;</span>emerge: modular Bitcoin mining rigs built into shipping containers. These ultra-streamlined units can be sent to remote locations with large natural energy sources, which are often unused or underutilized due to their distance from end users. These onsite mining rigs eliminate that problem.</p><p>By using such a broad mix of energy sources, Bitcoin mining actually does a pretty decent job of reducing carbon emissions. In their 2020<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/faculty-research/centres/alternative-finance/publications/3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study/\" id=\"external-text-link-8\">study</a>, the CCAF estimated that about 39% of Bitcoin’s total energy consumption was carbon-neutral. (That’s about 2X better than the United States’ overall consumption.)</p><p>I believe that number will continue to increase over the next few years–and to understand why, you need to look at the way Bitcoin is designed at its core.</p><h2>Bitcoin is built to be hyper-competitive</h2><p>A few years ago, you could make decent money mining Bitcoin in your own home with a relatively modest setup. It’s much harder now (hence the shipping container rigs). We don’t need to get too technical here, but essentially, the math problems mining machines need to solve become more complex over time (and will continue to do so).</p><p>This framework is called “<a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake\" id=\"external-text-link-9\">proof of work</a>.” It basically means that in order to create and sustain Bitcoin, you need to prove that your machines are doing a great deal of complicated computing. As that landscape becomes more competitive, proof of work will always require more energy to use.</p><p>That poses an obvious problem for Bitcoin miners: fossil fuels are<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/02/why-gas-got-so-expensive/622887/\" id=\"external-text-link-10\">expensive</a>. Renewables, like solar, wind, and hydro, are much<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/renewables-cheapest-energy-source/#:~:text=Of%20the%20wind%2C%20solar%20and,the%20equivalent%20share%20for%202019.\" id=\"external-text-link-11\">cheaper</a>–and their costs are<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/renewables-cheapest-energy-source/#:~:text=Of%20the%20wind%2C%20solar%20and,the%20equivalent%20share%20for%202019.\" id=\"external-text-link-12\">falling</a><span>&nbsp;</span>across the board each year. Thus, Bitcoin actually has an incredibly clear incentive to move towards greener energy. Long tail, I would say that Bitcoin will actually be a driver for the financialization of greentech. The green stuff is the cheap stuff.</p><p>Plus, Bitcoin is just one of the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/863917/number-crypto-coins-tokens/\" id=\"external-text-link-13\">thousands</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of cryptocurrencies out there today–and it’s the only one that really needs to use the proof of work mechanism. There’s a better way emerging, and it’s about to get a huge boost.</p><h2>Proof of stake: a better way forward</h2><p>Unlike proof of work, a<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/pt/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake?utm_source=google_search_nb&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=9943088770&amp;utm_content=100067298945&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_creative=580583551384&amp;utm_device=c&amp;utm_placement=&amp;utm_network=g&amp;utm_location=9007894&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8Kuks_gIxzBHB-ZNH7DAR4rNBOYnVxHjPwyk1Wb6UNyJNdqaBlm6-r_p4aAtTOEALw_wcB\" id=\"external-text-link-14\">proof of stake</a><span>&nbsp;</span>system doesn’t reward users for using more computational power. Rather, proof of stake requires participants to “stake” a portion of their own crypto (almost like collateral) to earn a chance to contribute to the blockchain and earn a reward.</p><p>From a sustainability perspective, the benefits are clear–proof of stake isn’t a contest to build the biggest mining rig or chew up the most energy crunching numbers. Researchers estimate that proof of stake systems use<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030\" id=\"external-text-link-15\">99.99% less energy</a><span>&nbsp;</span>than proof of work. It’s also a better way to reward high-quality contributors and cull bad actors.</p><p>Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain after Bitcoin, has been<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/04/1046636/ethereum-blockchain-proof-of-stake/\" id=\"external-text-link-16\">working</a><span>&nbsp;</span>towards making the switch from proof of work to proof of stake since its inception in 2015. That change is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://forkast.news/headlines/ethereum-closer-to-pos-after-kiln/#:~:text=Ethereum's%20merge%20on%20the%20Kiln,the%20end%20of%20Q2%2C%202022.\" id=\"external-text-link-17\">expected</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to finally happen by the end of Q2 this year–and it’s the talk of the town in the industry.</p><p>Nearly every other crypto is following suit, except Bitcoin–and if you ask me, that’s the way it should be. Bitcoin is really the only blockchain that needs to stay on proof of work. There are many reasons for this, but simply put, Bitcoin is just too large and established to switch over now; doing so would throw the whole system into chaos.</p><p>That’s not the case for the roughly<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/solana-internet-computer-terra-5-worst-performing-cryptos-past-week-2022-4#:~:text=With%20more%20than%2018%2C000%20cryptocurrencies,are%20US%20exchange%2Dlisted%20stocks.\" id=\"external-text-link-18\">18,000</a><span>&nbsp;</span>other cryptocurrencies in circulation. My “hot take” is that every single one should move to proof of stake, or another novel, green consensus mechanism, if they haven’t already. I see a future where Bitcoin mining (and, frankly, the rest of the world) has moved to renewable energy sources; the rest of the blockchains use proof of stake protocols; and the world’s toughest problems, like climate change, are solved by cutting-edge crypto projects that can help<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.mentholprotocol.com/\" id=\"external-text-link-19\">offset carbon emissions</a>,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3a68b7f8baef34b28839dd8365551c51b8bbcb43/3\" id=\"external-text-link-20\">reforest the planet</a>, and optimize the global energy supply.</p><h2>Republic is building that future</h2><p>We’re incredibly lucky here to be working with many crypto projects pursuing that same vision.

But they’d be right back at square one with the next campaign not knowing what to make for that next win. And when things went poorly, it was worse.Since the stakes were so high, and because all of our clients shared this problem — we wanted to solve it.Brennan, this is not your first time founding a company—what do you think is the most important skill founders need to succeed?  Grit is the most important skill founders need and the second most important isn’t even close. Every founder brings different kinds of magic to the company. But what each of them absolutely needs is grit.In the beginning of every startup’s life, there will be scary times where the founder is worried about making payroll or worried about losing a key customer, or some other thing that is essential to the company. Regardless of whether you’re a technical, creative, visionary, or other style of co-founder, your resolve to stay the course and fix the problem will be tested.It's hard to argue with numbers, but some people will anyway. Have you ever come across potential clients that were more difficult to convince away from their instincts? If so, how did you get through to them?We see that reaction every day. The average person is going to be a little incredulous when they encounter a brand new technology. It’s natural.Our approach is “the proof is in the pudding”. With Cortex, we let customers try us for free first. It’s like test driving a Tesla. Leading a design sprint with The ForceIt’s all hypothetical until you’re in the driver's seat, and wowed by the acceleration.  Once they see that taking the sunglasses off people in their ads doubles performance? They’re pretty convinced.How did you meet your co-founder? How do you work together?Matt and I have been friends since middle school. We met in study hall and have been friends for 28 years:  through two companies, funerals, weddings, and everything in between.We have a superpower as a founding team in that we never fight. We both want to get to the solution as fast as possible, we have our eyes on the prize, and we're willing to admit when we’re wrong. Any disagreement ends in less than half an hour.The only unsolvable problem we’ve encountered in the partnership in the past 15 years of working together is that he's allergic to my dogs.Brennan's pups!Would you say that Cortex makes advertising pros obsolete? Why or why not? Not at all. We see our software as the ultimate support for creative folks everywhere. In fact, the mission of the company is “to unlock the power of the world’s creatives”. Cortex doesn’t replace anyone, it empowers them.They all have similarly frustrating experiences where, because creative jobs are “subjective”, the bosses of creative people frequently make arbitrary changes, often last minute, with little to no reason other than personal preference. It undermines the strategy and the work and isn’t fixable through words alone.Cortex solves all of the above with one fell swoop and it’s beautiful and easy to use to boot. Advertising folks love us.Do you see ad firms as competition or collaborators?Collaborators. Ad agencies like Accenture, Dentsu, and Edelman are some of our best customers and resellers. We solve many of their toughest problems and reduce the risk of failing a huge campaign - the biggest reason they lose clients.What are the biggest challenges you’ve faced while launching your company?Since we came from the bootstrapping world, where we didn’t have or need funding, we didn’t bring any understanding of that world with us to this business. The founders at New Hampshire Motor Speedway!Our mentors at Techstars Boston helped us understand how the financing side of the software world works. They were a huge help and largely responsible for helping us see the change in strategy we needed on the fundraising sideHave you learned anything new or surprising about yourself through this process? When I was young, I never wanted to be a CEO or a visible face of a company. I’d always envisioned being the behind-the-scenes guy focused on making things run. Since becoming CEO of Cortex, I’ve realized that the same skills that enabled me to be captain of my college rugby team and president of student clubs are super relevant in business. It feels natural to lead as long as I clearly and frequently communicate my vision and continually check in with my team.In rugby, it was understanding the opposing team and calling plays to drive the ball downfield. In business it’s seeing the opportunity and competitors and calling plays to drive the company toward the goal. I love the role and didn’t anticipate feeling this way,For Matt— You're an angel investor. What kinds of companies catch your eye, and how do you translate your experiences as a founder into thinking about who to help fund?I invest primarily in people. Ideas are often a dime a dozen and even ifEnjoying the Boston skyline something is new and unique, it won't be for long. As a founder and operator, I know that exceptional people are the key to success. I try to find entrepreneurs who I would invest in even before hearing their idea. Why did you decide to raise from the crowd via Republic?We had previously had success with crowdfunding, oversubscribing our first Reg CF round. When doing it again, we wanted to give Republic a try as it seemed like it had the highest bar to entry. Like applying to an Ivy League school, we wanted to try to be among the best companies out there.Personally, I love the fact that the barriers for everyday folks to make life-changing money are being removed by the crowdfunding space. And as a CEO, I love that there are lots of options for early stage funding. It’s a great system for all involved and seemed like a natural option for our last fundraise before we start raising large dollars from institutional investors.What’s your team culture like? Our team is fully remote due to COVID, and was partially The team at a Bruins gameremote before that. So working together while not physically together has been something we’re all quite good at. We are all fun-loving folks, and when together we like to go boating on Boston Harbor, to Boston Bruins games, or other fun outings. What is your superpower?My superpower is also my kryptonite —I do not borrow other people’s thoughts. I have to do my own thinking. I have to know why things work the way they do, regardless of what other people think.This is a superpower because I see technology trends very early and can benefit financially.What’s your kryptonite?My kryptonite is the other side of the coin from my superpower. Because I don’t borrow others’ thoughts, I often take longer than necessary to validate advice or feedback from advisors. Some people get feedback from someone they trust and adopt it immediately. I often solicit more feedback, then go get my own data to validate that feedback. It takes much longer and often ends with the advisor saying “Yeah, I told you that last week”. Do you have any unusual routines or habits? I collect silver coins and, since I’m always fidgeting and moving, I am almost constantly playing with silver in my hand. Even when in Zoom calls or video interviews, just off camera, my hands are most likely fiddling with some silver coins or bars. The Founders before Cortex was bornWhat do you like to do in your spare time? Please share more about your hobbies and interests outside of work. Besides playing with my dogs, I love going to the gym and challenging myself to beat my previous records. When not doing that, I love traveling with friends and family. I’d love to visit every country on Earth before I die, and I’ve got a lot more to see.Are there any apps or gadgets that you can’t live without? I’m a SUPER quantified-self guy. So anything that tracks my body/performance is an immediate must-try. I’m currently addicted to my Lumen. It’s a metabolism tracker that you breathe into. I also use the Whoop Strap, a fitness/sleep/recovery tracker, and the Nutrisense blood sugar tracking sensor/app daily. I can’t wait until all of this data is just passively available on your phone via a watch or an embedded sensor in your skin. My sleep used to be terrible and I did a total 180 with the data with a combo of different apps. If you could give yourself one piece of advice 5 years ago, what would it be?I’d love to tell myself to take periodic breaks to spend time with family. You never know how much time you have together. What’s the best piece of advice you’ve received?If you’re going through hell, keep going. Do you have a(ny) mentor(s)? If so, what have they taught you?Tons of mentors, mostly due to Techstars Boston. They’ve taught me that, by default, I under communicate and undersell things. They made me realize that it’s expected of a CEO in my position to regularly draw attention to the exciting stuff that the Cortex team is working on. Previously, I kept my communication mostly internal and I didn't realize how much communicating the cool internal stuff to the outside world truly matters.", "content": "<h3>What’s the inspiration behind Cortex?</h3><p>At our first company, a content creation agency, every customer was wrestling with the same underlying problem — they never knew what videos and photos to make.&nbsp;<span class=\"fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dii fr-fil\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; position: relative; max-width: 100%; display: inline-block; float: left; vertical-align: bottom; margin: 8px 32px 16px 0px; width: 409px;\"><span class=\"fr-img-wrap\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; display: block; margin: auto; padding: 0px; text-align: center;\"></span></span></p><div class=\"se-component se-image-container __se__float- __se__float-none\" contenteditable=\"false\"><figure style=\"margin: 0px;\"><img src=\"https://republic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=730,dpr=2/https://uploads.republic.com/p/images/attachments/original/000/058/146/58146-1643049885-7428fd80906faece8d7382c1a3c786831810caab.jpg\" data-origin=\"100,\" alt=\"\" data-proportion=\"true\" data-size=\"407px,305px\" data-align=\"\" data-index=\"0\" data-file-name=\"58146-1643049885-7428fd80906faece8d7382c1a3c786831810caab.jpg\" data-file-size=\"0\" style=\"width: 407px; height: 305px;\"></figure></div><span class=\"fr-inner\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; display: block; margin-top: 8px; font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; color: rgb(119, 119, 119);\">At the Inc 5,000 Awards</span>They never knew where to spend their money in such a creative, subjective space—guessing what the audiences wanted to see.<p></p><p>When things went well, it led to awards and promotions for our clients.

The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi has grown by over 500%, from $51 billion to over $207 billion since last March, and multiple blockchains are claiming a larger share of the growing DeFi market.DeFi services are becoming more accessible than ever in this multi-chain environment. Yet most blockchains share the same kind of architecture and therefore face the same problems. The onboarding of new users leads to network congestion, transaction speeds slow down, and the cost of using these blockchains tends to rise when this happens. A different kind of blockchain, Solana, is demonstrating a speed and throughput that’s capable of onboarding a billion new users to DeFi. Not only that, Solana is attracting a large number of developers who are building DeFi projects ready to meet this growing demand.  Why Many DeFi Builders are Developing Projects on SolanaWith a current advertised maximum of 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), Solana may be one of the few blockchains with the ability to host a global financial system. Moreover, transaction fees on Solana cost only hundredths of a penny.Users want cheap and fast transactions, and Solana is definitely cheap and fast. For these reasons, the user experience on Solana is hard to beat.Solana’s founders developed eight core innovations that enable transactions to be finalized more efficiently in terms of both cost and speed. As a result, a recent report from Bank of America asserted that Solana has the potential to become the Visa of the digital asset world.When you combine all of these factors together, it’s not hard to imagine why investors, developers, and users are flocking to Solana.  Solana Builds Big on Composability and Money LegosThere’s a huge network effect that comes with Solana’s incredible bandwidth. Solana can onboard millions of new users without having to raise the cost for transactions, but this isn’t the only upside.Users can benefit from something called composability, or “money Legos,” a phenomenon that allows DeFi projects on the same network to integrate each others’ services to create new products. Legos are produced in many shapes and sizes, but every Lego block is designed to snap onto another Lego block, letting you build whatever your imagination desires. In a similar way, DeFi projects built on the same network can be connected with each other to make incredible ideas a reality. In this context, Solana is a base layer Lego block with tons of room for adding layer upon layer of Legos. So, the projects building on Solana today are creating the next layer of money Legos, the foundations on which future DeFi projects can build.Stablecoins Build Next Layer of Money Legos for Sustainable DeFi on SolanaAn example of a project building the next layer of money Legos on Solana is Hubble Protocol. Hubble’s main contribution to building Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is USDH, a crypto-backed and censorship-resistant stablecoin. USDH is censorship-resistant because it’s fully backed in value by crypto assets like Bitcoin’s BTC, Ethereum’s ETH, and Solana’s SOL. If these tokens, which cannot be “shut off,” hold their value, then so does USDH.Stablecoins are essential to DeFi. One could say that stablecoins are the money in the money Legos of DeFi. However, many of the most widely used stablecoins in DeFi have several points of failure due to their centralized issuance and backing by fiat currency. It’s widely known that third parties cannot censor or freeze a decentralized blockchain asset like bitcoin. On the other hand, it’s been demonstrated that fiat in a bank account can be frozen, which is problematic if that fiat is the backing for a stablecoin. There have also been instances where stablecoins have been frozen by their issuer, even when they’re held on a decentralized network. These actions could be disastrous for the DeFi community, so Hubble’s USDH is a stablecoin designed to avoid these points of failure. How USDH Brings a Successful Stablecoin Model to Solana DeFiA comparison can be made between Hubble’s USDH and MakerDAO’s DAI, a stablecoin that launched in 2017 on Ethereum. DAI was developed to provide the crypto community with a stablecoin that would be more censorship-resistant than its centralized counterparts.At the time of writing, DAI is one of the top-five stablecoins in crypto (over $9 billion in circulation), and many projects on Ethereum have been built on DAI as a “money lego.” Continuing on the principles pioneered by MakerDAO, Hubble allows users to deposit their crypto assets and borrow a censorship-resistant stablecoin to use in DeFi. The benefit for users is they get to keep their long position on an asset while gaining liquidity they can put to work. The benefit for the DeFi community as a whole is that it has a strong primitive to build on through USDH.Hubble isn’t just copying a great idea. It has made several improvements to MakerDAO’s model, as USDH hopes to do for Solana what DAI has done for Ethereum.On Hubble, users can deposit multiple kinds of assets at once to borrow USDH, and they can borrow an extremely capital efficient 90.9% loan-to-value (LTV) before facing liquidation. The cherry on top is that USDH can be borrowed for 0% interest. How Composability and USDH Improves DeFi on Solana As mentioned earlier, one of Solana’s strengths is the composability of the network–the ability for developers to build products and services like they’re putting together money Legos.By leveraging the power of composability, Hubble lets users opt into DeFi yield strategies with their crypto assets, while at the same time borrowing USDH against those assets. This is a huge development for crypto-backed stablecoins.For example, if you deposited ETH into MakerDAO to borrow DAI in 2018, you watched the price of ETH rise, but you wouldn’t have seen your token holdings rise as well. If you deposited 10 ETH in 2018, you can withdraw 10 ETH in 2022. With Hubble, you can still let your tokens work in DeFi to increase your token holdings, even when you’re using those tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins. That means when you deposit 10 ETH on Hubble, you can withdraw more than 10 ETH over time.This is a huge advantage for DeFi users on Solana. Before Hubble, if you deposited your crypto assets to borrow stablecoins, you lost the chance to stake or lend those tokens. And, vice versa, if you staked your tokens, they were trapped in a staking contract, and you would have to withdraw them if you wanted to start borrowing. Hubble has changed the game by allowing Solana’s DeFi users to essentially have their cake and eat it too. It will be interesting to see what will be developed in the future with such an integral piece of Solana’s money Legos in place.", "content": "<p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">Over the past year, decentralized finance (DeFi) has exploded in both value and adoption.

If these tokens, which cannot be “shut off,” hold their value, then so does USDH.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">Stablecoins are essential to DeFi. One could say that stablecoins are the money in the money Legos of DeFi. However, many of the most widely used stablecoins in DeFi have several points of failure due to their centralized issuance and backing by fiat currency.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">It’s widely known that third parties cannot censor or freeze a decentralized blockchain asset like bitcoin. On the other hand, it’s been demonstrated that fiat in a bank account can be frozen, which is problematic if that fiat is the backing for a stablecoin. There have also been instances where stablecoins have been frozen by their issuer, even when they’re held on a decentralized network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">These actions could be disastrous for the DeFi community, so Hubble’s USDH is a stablecoin designed to avoid these points of failure.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">How USDH Brings a Successful Stablecoin Model to Solana DeFi</span></h2><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">A comparison can be made between Hubble’s USDH and MakerDAO’s DAI, a stablecoin that launched in 2017 on Ethereum. DAI was developed to provide the crypto community with a stablecoin that would be more censorship-resistant than its centralized counterparts.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">At the time of writing, DAI is one of the top-five stablecoins in crypto (over $9 billion in circulation), and many projects on Ethereum have been built on DAI as a “money lego.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">Continuing on the principles pioneered by MakerDAO, Hubble allows users to deposit their crypto assets and borrow a censorship-resistant stablecoin to use in DeFi. The benefit for users is they get to keep their long position on an asset while gaining liquidity they can put to work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">The benefit for the DeFi community as a whole is that it has a strong primitive to build on through USDH.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">Hubble isn’t just copying a great idea. It has made several improvements to MakerDAO’s model, as USDH hopes to do for Solana what DAI has done for Ethereum.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">On Hubble, users can deposit multiple kinds of assets at once to borrow USDH, and they can borrow an extremely capital efficient 90.9% loan-to-value (LTV) before facing liquidation. The cherry on top is that USDH can be borrowed for 0% interest.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">How Composability and USDH Improves DeFi on Solana&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">As mentioned earlier, one of Solana’s strengths is the composability of the network–the ability for developers to build products and services like they’re putting together money Legos.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">By leveraging the power of composability, Hubble lets users opt into DeFi yield strategies with their crypto assets,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">while</span><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">at the same time</span><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;borrowing USDH against those assets. This is a huge development for crypto-backed stablecoins.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">For example, if you deposited ETH into MakerDAO to borrow DAI in 2018, you watched the price of ETH rise, but you wouldn’t have seen your token holdings rise as well. If you deposited 10 ETH in 2018, you can withdraw 10 ETH in 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">With Hubble, you can still let your tokens work in DeFi to increase your token holdings, even when you’re using those tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins. That means when you deposit 10 ETH on Hubble, you can withdraw more than 10 ETH over time.</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is a huge advantage for DeFi users on Solana. Before Hubble, if you deposited your crypto assets to borrow stablecoins, you lost the chance to stake or lend those tokens. And, vice versa, if you staked your tokens, they were trapped in a staking contract, and you would have to withdraw them if you wanted to start borrowing.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; vertical-align: baseline;\">Hubble has changed the game by allowing Solana’s DeFi users to essentially have their cake and eat it too. It will be interesting to see what will be developed in the future with such an integral piece of Solana’s money Legos in place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>", "header_image": "cd58a00f-6980-4cba-aea5-bacab5735399", "post_status": "publish", "comment_status": "open", "tags": null, "slug": "the-rise-of-solana-defis-money-legos"}}, {"model": "learning_board.blogpost", "pk": "74e08bdb-2489-44f0-a6c3-9bdf2c2515ce", "fields": {"author": "e1b86b84-0907-412c-bc8a-a3aca20554da", "created_at": "2022-05-14T10:51:33.610Z", "modified_at": "2022-05-14T10:51:33.610Z", "title": "Investing in Startups 101", "category": "d73acbc1-4aa1-4202-b6d5-b36a7dc59bc8", "excerpt": "The high-speed world of startups, and the risks of investing in them, are well documented, but startup investing can be complicated and there is a lot of information you should know ", "raw_content": "The high-speed world of startups, and the risks of investing in them, are well documented, but startup investing can be complicated and there is a lot of information you should know before making your first investment.This article will try to answer the question “why should you invest in a startup?” by giving you information about the process and what to expect from investing in an early-stage business. If you already know the drill, head on over to StartEngine to see the latest companies raising capital.Why invest in startups?Through equity crowdfunding, you can support and invest in startups that you are passionate about. This is different than helping a company raise capital via Kickstarter. You aren’t just buying their product or merch. You are buying a piece of that company. When you invest on StartEngine, you own part of that company, whether it’s one you are a loyal customer of, a local business you want to support, or an idea you believe in.Investing in startups means that you get to support entrepreneurs and be a part of the entrepreneurial community, which can provide its own level of excitement. You also support the economy and job creation: in fact, startups and small businesses account for 64% of new job creation in the US.In other words, you are funding the future. And by doing so, you may make money on your investment.But here’s the bad news: 90% of startups fail. With those odds, you’re more than likely to lose the money you invest in a startup.However, the 10% of startups that do succeed can provide an outsized return on the initial investment. In fact, when VCs invest, they are looking for only a few “home run” investments to make up for the losses that will compose the majority of their portfolio. Even the pros expect a low batting average when investing in startups.This is why the concept of diversifying your portfolio is important in the context of startup investing. Statistically, the more startup investments you make, the more likely you are to see better returns through your portfolio. Data collected across 10,000 Angellist portfolios supports this idea. In other words, the old piece of advice “don’t put all your eggs in one basket” holds true when investing in startups.Who can invest in startups?Traditionally, startup investing was not available to the general public. Only accredited investors had access to startup investment opportunities. Accredited investors are those who:Have made over $200,000 in annual salary for the past two years ($300,000 if combined with a spouse), orHave over $1M in net worth, excluding their primary residenceThat meant only an estimated 10% of US households had access to these opportunities. Equity crowdfunding changes all of that and levels the playing field. On platforms like StartEngine, anyone over the age of 18 can invest in early-stage companies.What are you buying?The Breakdown of Securities Offered via Reg CF as of December 31, 2020The Breakdown of Securities Offered via Reg CF as of December 31, 2020When you invest in startups, you can invest through different types of securities. Those include:Common stock, the simplest form of equity. Common stock, or shares, give you ownership in a company. The more you buy, the greater the percentage of the company you own. If the company grows in value, what you own is worth more, and if it shrinks, what you own is worth less.Debt, essentially a loan. You, the investor, purchase promissory notes and become the lender. The company then has to pay back your loan within a predetermined time window with interest.Convertible notes, debt that converts into equity. You buy debt from the company and earn interest on that debt until an established maturity date, at which point the debt either converts into equity or is paid back to you in cash.SAFEs, a variation of convertible note. SAFEs offer less protection for investors (in fact, we don’t allow them on StartEngine) and include no provisions about cash payout, so you as an investor are dependent upon the SAFE converting into equity, which may or may not occur at some point in the future.Most of the companies on StartEngine sell a form of equity, so the rest of this article will largely focus on equity investments.How can a company become successful if they only raise $X?Startup funding generally works in funding rounds, meaning that a company raises capital several times over the course of their life span. A company just starting out won’t raise $10M because there’s no indication that it would be a good investment. Why would someone invest $10M in something totally unproven?Instead, that new company may raise a few hundred thousand dollars in order to develop proof-of-concept, make a few initial hires, acquire their first users, or reach any other significant business developments in order to “unlock” the next round of capital.In essence, with each growth benchmark a company is able to clear, they are able to raise more money to sustain their growth trajectory. In general, each funding round is bigger than the previous round to meet those goals.When do companies stop raising money? When their revenue reaches a point where the company becomes profitable enough that they no longer need to raise capital to grow at the speed they want to.What happens to my equity investment if a company raises more money later?If you invest in an early funding round of a startup and a year or two later that same company is raising more money, what happens to your investment? If things are going well, you will experience what is known as “dilution.” This is a normal process as long as the company is growing.The shares you own are still yours, but new shares are issued to new buyers in the next funding round. This means that the number of shares you own is now a smaller percentage of the whole, and this is true for everyone who already holds shares, including the company’s founders.However, this isn’t a problem in itself. If the company is doing well, in the next funding round, the company will have a higher valuation and possibly a different price per share. This means that while you now own a smaller slice of the total pie, the pie is bigger than what it was before, so your shares are worth more than they were previously too. Everybody wins.If the company isn’t growing though, it leads to what is known as a down round. A down round is when a company raises more capital but at a lower valuation, which can increase the rate of dilution as well as reduce the value of investors’ holdingsHow can I make money off a startup investment?Traditionally, there are two ways investors can “exit” their investment. The first is through a merger/acquisition. If another company acquires the one you invested in, they will often offer a premium to buy your shares and so secure a controlling ownership percentage in the company. Sometimes your shares will be exchanged at dollar value for shares in the acquiring company.The other traditional form of an exit is if a company does an initial public offering and becomes one of the ~4,000 publicly trading companies in the US. Then an investor can sell their shares on a national exchange. Those events can take anywhere from 5-10 years to occur. This creates an important difference between startup investing and investing in companies on the public market: the time horizon is different.When investing in a public company, you can choose to sell that investment at any time. However, startup investments are illiquid, and you may not be able to exit that investment for years.However, equity crowdfunding can provide an alternative to both of these options: the shares sold through equity crowdfunding are tradable immediately (for Regulation A+) and after one year (for Regulation Crowdfunding) on alternative trading systems (ATS), if the company chooses to quote its shares on an ATS. This theoretically reduces the risk of that investment as well because the longer an investment is locked up, the greater the chance something unpredictable can happen.ConclusionInvesting in startups is risky, but it is an exciting way to diversify your portfolio and join an entrepreneur’s journey.

Overall growth is strong, and we are very encouraged by our performance. Top line revenue growth went up 146% year-over-year to $13.36 million for the first half of 2021, and we successfully transitioned from losses to profits of over $2 million. Our traditional crowdfunding business for startups continues to expand, and we are diversifying into other alternative assets as well. As part of our goal to increase liquidity for investors, we’ve also launched our own secondary trading platform.Financial StrengthAcross the board, we are pleased with the growth achieved through the first six months of the year ended June 30.Top line revenue growth is up 146% year over year to $13.36 million, with gross profits up 186% to $11.19 million in the first half of 2021. For context, StartEngine’s total full year revenues in 2020 were $12.5 million. We did more revenue in the first 6 months of 2021 than we did in all of 2020.We successfully transitioned from operating at a loss, to producing operating income of $2.13 million.Net income of $2.09 million, or $0.07 per share through the first half of the year vs. a loss of $0.04 per share during the same period in 2020.Total shareholders equity (the company’s total assets minus total liabilities) of $25.38 million vs. $8.8 million in June of 2020.Regulation crowdfunding remains the largest piece of our business, with revenues increasing 153% year over year to $6.94 million. We believe the growth in the amounts was partially driven by the laws increasing the cap limits for Regulation CF offerings to $5 million. Commissions from Regulation A offerings are our second highest source of revenue, bringing in $3.57 million in the first half of the year. The average amount raised by issuers is increasing, which helped grow this segment of the business by 264% year over year.Looking AheadWhile pleased with our financial results through the first half of the year, StartEngine remains focused on the future. To date, we have raised over $400 million for businesses. Our goal is to carry out $10 billion in equity raises by 2029. Based on current trends, we don’t see our growth slowing down. Cash flow is strong, and we are continually working to increase both the quantity, and quality of crowdfunding options. To do this, StartEngine is expanding further into alternative assets through StartEngine Collectibles. Our first foray outside of startups is wine collections. This is an asset class quickly gaining popularity due to its ability to compete with the S&P 500 over time. Our first five wine collections have already sold out, with more planned for the future. Soon we’ll be adding options like real estate, sports memorabilia and more.StartEngine Secondary is our new trading platform where investors can buy and sell shares in certain companies that have raised capital on StartEngine.

If you plan to invest in a startup, one of the concepts you want to fully understand is dilution. Dilution occurs when a company conducts another funding round in the future and issues new shares to investors. When the total number of shares held by all investors in a company increases, each shareholder ends up owning a smaller, or diluted, percentage of the company.To help put this into perspective, the term dilution means the same in the financial world as it does in the world of fruity drinks.The Cranberry Juice ExampleImagine a pitcher of cranberry juice. If you add water to your pitcher, you are diluting the concentration of the cranberry juice, but you can pour more glasses of juice from the pitcher.A similar thing happens to your ownership percentage in a company as the company raises more capital from investors. Just substitute the cranberry juice for ownership of the company and the water for shares in the company.Let’s say a pitcher of cranberry juice represents a company called Cranberry Company. Every shareholder in Cranberry Company gets a glass of juice from this pitcher. Some shareholders get larger glasses than others, depending on how much money they invested (more money buys a larger glass), but everyone’s glass is poured from the same pitcher.As the company raises more capital by issuing new shares, water gets added to the pitcher, so the pitcher can fill glasses of juice for all of the new shareholders. In that process, the cranberry juice gets diluted.So now when the pitcher gets poured into shareholders’ glasses, everyone has less cranberry juice in their glass (meaning everyone owns a smaller % of the company), but everyone still gets the same sized glass poured, based on the number of shares they own.That’s equity dilution in a nutshell pitcher.How Dilution Plays a Role in Funding RoundsThe reason you must pay attention to dilution is because startups typically conduct multiple rounds of financing, whether to reach a point of profitability or to finance accelerated growth. And with each round of financing, new shares are issues, which means percent ownership of all existing shareholders will be diluted. So, the earlier you invest in a company’s stage of development, the more dilution you will have to deal with. For this reason, it is wise to learn the various stages of development a startup goes through.The typical funding rounds include: Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, B, C and later rounds. Let’s walk through what this looks like in practice with our previous example Cranberry Company.Pre-Seed FundingLet’s say the founders of Cranberry Company value their business at $1M in a pre-seed funding round. The company has 1,000,000 shares on their cap table. The founders set aside 800,000 shares for themselves (so they own 80% of the company) and decide to sell 20% of the company (200,000 shares) to investors at $1 per share and raise $200,000 in funding.You invest $10,000 in Cranberry Company in this pre-seed round and receive 10,000 shares of stock. As a result, you have a 1% (10,000 ÷ 1,000,000) ownership interest in the company.Seed FundingA year later, Cranberry Company decides to raise more money. This time, they set a valuation of $5M and raise $1M at $5 per share. However, all of Cranberry Company’s 1,000,000 shares are accounted for—the founders own 800,000 shares, and they issued 200,000 in the pre-seed round.This means that the company needs to issue 200,000 new shares in their seed funding round, bringing the total outstanding shares to 1,200,000.Previously, you owned 1% of the company (10,000 shares of 1,000,000 shares outstanding), but as a result of this new funding round, you now own approximately .83% of the company (10,000 shares of Cranberry Company’s 1,200,000 shares).However, while you own less of the company than you did previously, your investment in this example is actually worth more. You invested when Cranberry Company was valued at $1M, and the share price was set at $1. In their seed funding round, Cranberry Company set a valuation of $5M, so your initial investment of $10,000 is now worth $50,000 on paper (10,000 shares at $5 per share).If the company grows and does well, then through each successive funding round, from Series A to Series B and beyond, your investment can actually increase in value even as the percentage of the company that you own decreases. However, that is not always the case.Down RoundsFor example, let’s say that Cranberry Company struggled to close their seed funding round. Almost out of cash, the company agrees to accept a lower valuation to raise capital in a bridge round and extend their runway for a few more months.Cranberry Company raises $320,000 at an $800K valuation. Similar to the above seed funding round, the company issues 400,000 shares in this bridge round, but this time they are sold at $.80 per share.As a result of this bridge round, your investment represents approximately .71% of the company (originally it was a 1% stake in the company), and your investment of $10,000 is now worth $8,000 (10,000 shares at $.80 per share).Dilution will occur every time the company issues new shares, but depending on how well the company is doing, and at what valuation the company issues shares, your original investment can increase (or decrease) in value independently of what % of the company you now own.Stock Options & DilutionDilution can also happen when holders of stock options, which typically consist of employees of the company, exercise their options. A holder of a stock option has the right to purchase shares at a specific price in the future known as the strike price.The shares associated with the stock option pool are authorized but not yet outstanding. For example, an employee named Mary has a signed stock option grant notice with the company, and the shares in that grant notice are authorized. When Mary purchases her options at the strike price, she has “exercised” her options.Once this happens, Mary’s newly purchased shares become new shares outstanding, and as a result, the ownership interests of all shareholders prior to the exercise of her options will be diluted.Convertible Notes & DilutionAnother situation where dilution plays a role is when outstanding convertible notes are converted into equity. On StartEngine, some companies will offer convertible notes in their offering, which is debt that can later convert into equity.When those notes convert, they will create dilution for shareholders in the same way that new issuances of shares do. One important difference between convertible notes and equity is that convertible notes can come with a discount on the conversion price, which has ramifications for dilution.For example, let’s say you invested $10,000 in Cranberry Company during their pre-seed funding round, which offered convertible notes not equity, and those notes included a 20% discount rate.Two years later, Cranberry Company raises their seed round. Same as before, the company sets a valuation of $5M and raises $1M at $5 per share.For new investors in the seed round, a $10,000 investment would translate to 2,000 shares. However, with that 20% discount, holders of the convertible note receive 2,500 shares (the 20% discount means the original $10,000 investment would convert into equity at $4 per share rather than $5 per share).The additional shares issued impact dilution for new investors while offering some protections for the upside of early investors by preventing their riskier investments from being valued equally to later, safer investments. Convertible notes can also include other terms, such as valuation caps or interest rates that can also impact dilution if and when the convertible notes convert into equity.ConclusionAs a startup investor, it’s important to understand how future funding rounds can impact your investments.

I do not know why. Maybe it is because running a fast-growing company requires vision and hard work. 2021 was one of those years. We finished the year with a big bang, and we are looking at 2022 as trying to climb the Yosemite North face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are the only equity crowdfunding company that releases its yearly revenues and now quarterly. In 2021, we achieved $28,841,227 in revenue (unaudited) compared to $12,574,218 in 2020. This is a staggering growth of 129%. Our gross margins improved from 73% to 81%. We had a loss of $991,073 (unaudited) compared to a loss of $2,584,360 in 2020.</p><h2>H<strong>ow did we achieve this?</strong></h2><p>We have a formidable team of 100+ people who work tirelessly to help entrepreneurs raise capital, and help investors gain access to investment opportunities. I think the people were the most important factor.</p><p>We are proud to say that a great many of our entrepreneurs were either minorities or women.&nbsp; This is in itself a great achievement.&nbsp; I have said many times that when you remove the barrier to accessing capital, unappreciated minorities and women will come.</p><h2>We raised $252,353,971 in capital for companies listed on our platform in 2021.</h2><p>This is enormous growth compared to $142,305,018 in 2020. Unlike our competitors, we do not add any capital invested in these companies from VCs or third parties of our platform. If we did, the numbers would go through the roof, but frankly, it is hot air and we prefer to keep our feet on the ground.</p><h2>We introduced StartEngine Collectibles</h2><p>…and sold out five wine offerings and a Marylin Monroe lithograph by Andy Warhol. We are launching new collectibles every week, and we hope to offer them on our Secondary trading platform after we get all the right paperwork in place. We believe that investments in collectibles are a new asset class that should be offered to main street investors. In the past, it has been mostly reserved for the very few and we all know why.</p><h2>We introduced the StartEngine REIT,</h2><p>which is a real estate fund to allow our investor community access to one of the most popular investment classes. SE REIT has the potential to appreciate in value while providing regular income. This asset class has a long-term investment profile when sold as private partnerships. However, with our fund, it will also be available on StartEngine Secondary sometime in the future without any guarantee of liquidity, but at least better than waiting 5 to 7 years, which is typical in these kinds of investments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021 we were fortunate to get the approval to create our own financial system and offer StartEngine accounts to our investment community. What does this mean? This is big because when we release it this year, our investors will have one account hosted at StartEngine that will carry the cash and securities all in one place. Think how Charles Schwab and E*trade operate. This is a real upgrade and gives us the ability to improve the speed of transactions and reduce our costs. Amazing.</p><h2>We launched our fourth OWN campaign that raised over $29M from our investor community.</h2><p>This was the largest raise on StartEngine regardless of companies and our largest offering ever.

Refilling the machines takes less than half an hour, according to Massimo. Massimo explained that this process would allow for a pizza brand to expand their business quickly and “for one tenth of the expense.”Everybody Understands PizzaPiestro has already raised over $2 million on StartEngine. The startup’s first Reg CF campaign raised $1.05 million in 2020, and a new Reg A+ raise is currently underway. “There’s a lot of interest,” Massimo says. “I’ve been in this business my whole entire life, and I love this model. I’ve had people that work with me in restaurants … and they’re bartenders, and they’re waiters, and they understand why this will work, and they all put money in it.”Massimo continued, “that’s the beauty of crowdfunding, right?”Mr. Wonderful agreed, and added that Piestro is a particularly good fit for the crowdfunding model, “because everybody understands pizza!”Cheesy AutomationMr. Wonderful wondered what the cost of production was for a Piestro machine. Massimo estimated that it would cost about $45,000 to make a machine. “We’ll be selling at around $75,000,” Massimo explained. Piestro also hopes to attract brand partnerships by allowing them to lease Piestro’s white-label machine in a SaaS (Software as a Service) model, where they pay around $3000 per month. “When people start seeing this thing actually working, I think it’s a feature in a store that people will actually want to watch,” said Mr. Wonderful. “It’s very interesting.”Massimo agreed, pointing out that Piestro machines have a big window through which customers can watch their pizza being made. “They can pick their own ingredients and say, ‘oh wow, those are the ingredients that I picked’ and watch all their ingredients fall on their pizza,” said Massimo. Mr. Wonderful asked whether someone needs to man the machine while it operates. “It’s completely independent,” replied Massimo. Piestro machines just need to be refilled, he explained. “It’s remote monitored, so if the refrigerator starts acting up or something, there’s an alert that’s sent out, but the machine is fully independent.”Mr. Wonderful was impressed, pointing out that existing pizza vending machines use a method where they reheat frozen pizzas, while Piestro uses fresh ingredients. Massimo added that existing machines only have a few different options to choose from, whereas Piestro allows consumers to customize their pie.What’s more, the automation doesn’t end there. Piestro has a partnership with Kiwibot, the robot delivery service, and so in locations with Kiwibot, the robot will pick up the pizza and deliver it to the customer. “Amazing,” said Mr. Wonderful.Help Yourself to a SliceTo conclude, Massimo said that there’s a lot of interest in Piestro at the moment, with over 5,000 pre-orders on the machine. “It’s pretty exciting.” (Editor’s note: Piestro provided StartEngine with commercial agreements indicating intent to purchase at least 4,100 units).Mr. Wonderful congratulated Massimo on Piestro’s success thus far and said he’d follow along for their fundraising journey. “I’ll send you a pizza as soon as it’s ready,” Massimo said. Mr. Wonderful replied, “Let me know when one’s in Miami! I want to go look at it.”", "content": "<p>StartEngine’s Strategic Advisor Kevin O’Leary (aka “Mr. Wonderful”) regularly sits down with companies on our platform in a series we call “Meet the Innovators.” In these conversations, Mr. Wonderful talks to founders about their startups and their experience raising capital on StartEngine.</p><p>This time, Mr. Wonderful spoke to Piestro CEO Massimo Noja De Marco about the company’s Regulation A+ campaign on StartEngine and the potential for people to access pizza at the touch of a button.&nbsp;</p><p>Piestro has built a fully-automated pizzeria that can make artisanal-style pizza in three minutes or less. “We have developed this machine that looks like a vending machine but in reality is a very sophisticated piece of technology,” said Massimo.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Baked-In Partnership Opportunities</strong></h2><p>Piestro’s machine is highly customizable, allowing new pizza recipes to be programmed in as necessary. “[We can] control every part of the machine at any given time remotely, so that any of the pizza brands that we go into partnership with are able to produce all of their regional recipes,” explained Massimo.&nbsp;</p><p>He went on to add that if Mr. Wonderful had a hypothetical pizza brand and was looking to expand its reach, adding a new location may cost up to $1 million or $1.5 million. “Now [Mr. Wonderful] can take a ‘Kevin pizza’ powered by Piestro — which is our white-label machine — and have five or 10 of these machines right around an area where he has his own restaurant,” said Massimo.</p><p>It would be the brick-and-mortar location’s job to prep and supply the ingredients to the Piestro machines.

He could no longer afford to keep feeding his dog the dry kibble he had been feeding him for years.Luckily, he was a professional chef trained at The French Culinary Institute.With the input of his local veterinarian and pet nutritionist, he began cooking a new formula. The ingredients also reflected the latest scientific research in pet nutrition. With the involvement of our nutrition-obsessed CEO, Jaron Lukas, this recipe evolved into the Yumwoof Perfect Kibble we offer today. How did you meet your co-founders? How do you work together?We have all been friends for over a decade—Ray and Yo have actually been friends since they were kids! Our long friendships have helped Yumwoof thrive. There’s nothing better than a relationship based on trust. Jaron and Yo previously co-founded Coinsetter, one of the first venture-backed bitcoin exchanges in the USA, which was sold to Kraken in 2016. Since then, we have collaborated on other ventures together and remain best friends.How do you handle risk and competition? While the pet food industry is competitive, we try to focus on our customers and creating unique products that stand out. Yumwoof has taken a strong stance on the importance of low carb diets for dogs. While it costs more not to include fillers like rice and potato, we’re uncompromising when it comes to our dogs’ health.For Jaron:  You're stepping into a CEO position again. What lessons are you bringing to Yumwoof from your previous experience?  I believe differentiation is the most important aspect to business success. This is something I learned early in my entrepreneurial career. When you’re starting a company, there will always be competitors—and usually some that are much larger than you. They have advantages a startup cannot replicate.That’s why I never follow or copy the competition. Startups who do that are always playing catch-up. I believe you should stand out as being unique, and that can only be accomplished by differentiating yourself through unique products.For Jaron: You have a large amount of press surrounding you personally. How has the recognition affected the way you work, if at all?During my Coinsetter days, I was regularly interviewed on CNBC, Fox Business News, The Wall Street Journal, and many other news outlets. It was a fun experience, but these days I’m more focused on writing articles that help customers learn about nutrition for their dogs and themselves. For Yo Sub:  This is your third time being a co-founder! What strengths have you needed as a serial entrepreneur? Persistence is one of my more important strengths because I've been a co-founder more than three times. Some of those times just didn't work out as well as they are with Yumwoof. I'd also say the ability to adapt. There are an infinite number of things that can go wrong while building a business, but figuring out what's needed to make things go right is the challenge and the fun.For Yo Sub: Your blockchain experience is coming into play with Yumwoof's upcoming open source food trial platform. What drove the decision to make it open for everyone? I've always been a big supporter of open source software and that's especially true in anything relating to blockchain. You need to secure the trust of the community by being open and ultimately you want everyone to use a technology if it betters the field in doing so.For Raymond:  Web development and gourmet cuisine seem like they're worlds apart! What made you decide to work in both fields? Web development and the culinary world are connected through artistry! I've always been an artist at heart. Whether I was holding a chef's knife or keyboard designing the front-end of a website, aesthetics have always been a huge motivator for me. For Raymond:  How would you compare and contrast your time cooking for people vs cooking for dogs?I've spent most of my life cooking and working in restaurants. I was always fascinated by the unique \"personality\" that each establishment had, and the happiness that they brought to their guests. Cooking for dogs came hand in hand with this concept! I have always been a dog person, and was lucky enough to foster and adopt dogs after college. One of my dogs was not responding well to a certain kibble that I had, and that's when I began cooking for him. After seeing him have more energy and a happy tummy, I thought \"Why not do this all the time?\"What are the biggest challenges you’ve faced while launching your company?Launching a pet food company with just one recipe is a huge challenge. I always like to say that our first 9 months were the most difficult part of Yumwoof because we didn’t have any cross-selling capabilities. We’re glad to be past that with several great products to offer customers—especially those with picky eaters! Have you learned anything new or surprising about yourself through this process?All three co-founders came from tech backgrounds, so Yumwoof has been an education on running a classic physical business in our view. Some of our most important learnings that we’ve implemented into Yumwoof include smart product pricing, subscriptions and managing marketing costs.We’ve also been surprised to learn how dysfunctional the logistics industry is.Why did you decide to raise from the crowd via Republic?We chose to raise on Republic because we wanted to spread the word about our unique company and build a network of incentivized evangelists. There’s no other platform that compares!What’s your team culture like? We’re all nice people with a friendly culture. We take canine nutrition extremely seriously, and we can get very focused on making sure every little detail in what we do is right.What is your superpower?My superpower is creativity. Whether it’s marketing or product development, I’m always thinking outside-the-box coming up with new ideas I would personally use. What’s your kryptonite? My kryptonite is negativity. I keep it away through meditation and being selective in where I place my attention. Do you have any unusual routines or habits? I meditate for at least 30 minutes every day. As meditation gets more popular, that’s fortunately becoming a less unusual habit. I also go for walks with my dog almost every day. My most unusual habit is that I try not to have any routine (besides meditating and brushing my teeth) because I like to make every day different. What do you like to do in your spare time? I’m always planning trips! My favorite trip last year was to France for a wedding. And I’m currently planning my brother’s bachelor party to Oaxaca, Mexico.Are there any apps or gadgets that you can’t live without? I’d say Keywords Everywhere chrome app is a pretty useful tool I use regularly. It shows me search volumes on everything I google, which is really helpful for understanding trends. If you could give yourself one piece of advice 5 years ago, what would it be?Don’t sell any of your bitcoin.What’s the best piece of advice you’ve received?Happiness is the absence of striving for happiness.Do you have a(ny) mentor(s)? If so, what have they taught you?Anyone successful in what they do is my mentor.

According to Business Insider, when looking at economic recovery indicators, such as the 4% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and slight increase in retail sales, the economy continued to recover in Q4. If you compare Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 however, GDP declined by 2.5%, which shows that we’re not quite back to pre-pandemic levels.  Many governments imposed stricter lockdown measures to curb the virus’ spread in Q4, and as a result, the U.S. lost 140,000 jobs during December, expected hiring activity slowed, and in turn, consumer spending declined.Venture Capital FundingYet despite those economic trends, Pitchbook’s Venture Monitor for Q4 2020 reports that VC funds performed well. High-growth startups received record investments, exit value reached its second highest level ever, and there were a number record fund raises during the year.However, this data is skewed by mega-deals, which set annual records for deal count and deal value, as well as late-stage deals, which comprised 28.8% of the deal count yet represented 66.7% of total deal value in 2020. In fact, seed-stage deals and deals with companies that have never raised prior VC funding fell sharply last year.Fintech’s Year in Review While VC seed deals fell sharply, fintech registered an increase in overall deal activity of 11% during Q4 2020. Contrary to VC activity, early and mid-stage deals accounted for about 90% of the increase. When looking at all of 2020, global fintech investment declined slightly, however, considerable growth was realized in the North American and European fintech sectors, with Asia accounting for the decline.As part of that fintech growth, StartEngine itself has achieved significant growth in total funds raised during 2020. During 2020, companies raised more than $67.3M with StartEngine via Regulation Crowdfunding, more than doubling the amount StartEngine had raised via Reg CF from 2016-2019. And in total—looking at both Regulation A+ and Regulation CF—companies on StartEngine raised a total of $147M in 2020.Equity CrowdfundingLooking at equity crowdfunding and Regulation Crowdfunding specifically, as we mentioned above, Q4 2020 surpassed every other quarter to date in regard to funds raised. Companies raised $82.6M in Q4 2020!During the 4rd quarter of 2020, 365 companies launched Reg CF offerings compared to 316 companies launched in Q3. Both the number of deals launched using Reg CF and the total amounts raised have increased significantly during 2020.Industry ActivityAmount Raised in Q4 by IndustryAmount Raised in Q4 by IndustryFor the second quarter in a row, the food and beverage industry led the way, accounting for 15.5% of total funding in Q4, or $12.7M. Technology companies raised $7.4M, and media and entertainment companies raised $6.7M.5 of the top industries in the graph above (Banking & Investment, Media & Entertainment, Beverages, Real Estate and Transportation) are also included on a list of the most profitable industries in the US overall.This overlap implies that many companies that raise money using Regulation Crowdfunding operate in the most profitable, high-performing industries. Portal ActivityThe number of active funding portals fluctuated in 2020. In Q1, there were 15 funding portals with committed investments. In Q2, this figure jumped to 25 followed by a decline back to 15 active portals during Q3 and finally settling at 22 by the end of Q4.However, while there were 22 funding portals that saw investor activity in Q4, only 6 of those portals helped companies raise over $1M in that time.A total of 17 companies were able to raise over $1M in Q4 alone, and over 80% of funds raised in Q4 came from just three funding portals: Wefunder, StartEngine, and Republic.Security TypesReg CF Offerings by Security Type to DateReg CF Offerings by Security Type to DateThe most prevalent security types used to raise funds via Reg CF in the latest quarter were common stock, debt instruments, and SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), which comprised over 82.2% of all funds raised. This is compared to 81.2% recorded at the end of 2019. In other words, not much has changed in the last year in terms of what securities companies are using to raise capital under Reg CF.It should be noted that the SEC cautions against SAFE notes, and StartEngine has its own aversion to the security. However, the structure created by the famous accelerator, Y Combinator continues to be a popular security to use when raising funds via Regulation Crowdfunding.Attracting Companies With More MaturityBy the end of 2020, there have been a total of 3,217 Reg CF offerings to date. During Q4, 287 new offerings were launched.Interestingly, the maturity of the businesses leveraging Reg CF is changing. The companies seeking funding via Reg CF in Q4 2019 had average total assets of about $341K compared to $559K in Q4 2020. When looking at revenue, companies averaged about $308K in Q4 2019, which jumped to $768K in 2020. This data suggests larger, more established companies are opting to seek out investment dollars via Reg CF versus using older, traditional methods of startup financing.If you look at which regions dominate Regulation Crowdfunding, you may be surprised to see that Los Angeles County has raised the most capital to date, followed by New York, San Francisco, San Diego and Austin. These counties also grew the fastest during the year.Funds Raised to DateAnnual Growth RateLos Angeles County$53.7M76.6%New York County$30.5M68.5%San Francisco County$28.6M85.7%San Diego County$21.5M56.9%Travis County (Austin, TX)$19.3M85.5%Based on the data, Southern California is outperforming the rest of the country in terms of total funds raised, accounting for 3 of the top 5 counties in Reg CF. This may be unsurprising due to San Francisco already being a hotbed of startups venture capital and LA having a robust technology scene as well. What’s more surprising is the amount of Reg CF activity in Austin, TX. Austin is becoming recognized as an upcoming startup scene, recently attracting Tesla and the Boring Company, both of whom are building facilities in the city.StartEngine Q4Amount Raised in Q4 on StartEngine by CampaignAmount Raised in Q4 on StartEngine by CampaignIn Q4, 38 new equity crowdfunding offerings launched on StartEngine, and 5 companies reached $1M in funding, compared to 6 in Q3 and 5 in Q2. The companies that reached over $1M in Q4 included the hypersonic technology company HyperSciences, social network Fanbase, wireless power company WiGL—and more. Looking to the FutureA large contributor to equity crowdfunding’s growth in 2020 is COVID-19. The pandemic put pressure on many businesses to raise more funding in order to survive. Yet as access to capital became more competitive, the number of jobs lost due to COVID-19 during the first two quarters of 2020 helped pave the way towards a 26.7% year-over-year increase in new business formations from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020. With more companies seeking funding, and venture capital in seed deals drying up, more businesses than ever before turned to equity crowdfunding, and investors came to funding portals to meet them.So what does the future look like?With vaccinations taking place across the country, it’s just a matter of time before the economy returns to some semblance of normalcy. However, some industries have been forever changed as people have become accustomed to working remotely, receiving products and services on demand, and having more influence over companies and brands.For the interim, VCs are focusing on larger, more established deals, and this leaves room for substantial growth in the fintech industry, and specifically, equity crowdfunding, as it focuses on earlier-stage deals and everyday investors.One factor that will have a considerable effect on the growth of equity crowdfunding is the SEC rule changes that are scheduled to take effect by mid-March 2021. These changes will allow companies to raise more (Reg CF’s annual maximum funding goal will increase from $1.07M to $5M), and allow investors to invest more. As shown by the situation that occurred involving Robinhood and GameStop, the power of the retail investor is growing. The general public is showing a growing appetite for investment, and StartEngine, one of the largest companies in equity crowdfunding, is at the center of this shift.", "content": "<p>By the end of Q4,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>companies have raised a total of $500M via Regulation Crowdfunding to date!</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>At the end of 2019, the total amount of funds raised via Reg CF was $281M, and 2020’s growth represents a 78% increase for the industry.</p><p>Q4 2020 also set a new record for the amount raised in a single quarter!<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Companies raised $82.6M in Q4 2020</strong>, a substantial increase over figures reported in Q3 ($58.9M) and Q2 ($48.2M).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The Economy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>To put the phenomenal performance equity crowdfunding has achieved in 2020 into perspective, it’s important to look at the bigger picture.

That means that if you’re the founder of an early-stage business, funding is on your mind—and if it’s not, it should be. Many entrepreneurs turn to small business grants to help them raise funds in the early days of getting their business off the ground. Small business grants can come from nonprofit organizations, private companies or federal or state agencies, and don’t have to be repaid. But out of all your options, are they the best way to fund a new business? Let’s break down the pros and cons of small business grants, as well as some alternatives—like equity crowdfunding—to see which option is right for you.What are Small Business Grants?Small business grants are grants awarded to startups or established businesses. They can be given out by federal or state agencies, as well as nonprofits and private companies. They’re often targeted towards specific types of businesses, such as those owned by minorities or women, or, more recently, ones affected by the COVID-19 pandemic like restaurants, music venues or bars. Like angel investors, crowdfunding, small business loans and friends and family rounds, small business grants are one possible source of funding for your early-stage business.Small business grants are sometimes described as “free money,” which can be true—there’s generally no expectation that you’ll repay them, and they can offer the opportunity to grow your business at your discretion, without the pressure that comes with a loan or an investment. Too good to be true? Maybe. Grants often come with strings attached, and the application process can be time-consuming, especially when you consider the actual dollar amount of the grant.What is Equity CrowdfundingAnother option for small business is equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding is the process of sourcing early-stage funding from small investors in exchange for equity in your company through a platform like StartEngine. The number of small businesses raising startup funds through equity crowdfunding has exploded since 2020, as venture capital deals dropped by more than 40% due to COVID-19. So what are the key differences between equity crowdfunding and small business grants?Amount of FundsEstimates of the average start-up capital required by small business owners vary: the Wells Fargo Small Business Index Study found that the average owner uses about $10,000 of startup capital, while the Kauffman Firm Survey, consisting of mostly high-tech firms, put that number at $80,000 each year.The amount of money you’ll need to raise to get your business off the ground depends on a variety of factors, including your business plan, your anticipated profits and your overhead. Small business grants can be as small as $1,000 or as large as $100,000 or more, though you’re unlikely to reach the upper end of that range unless you’re an established company facing hardship. Regardless, grants tend to be a fixed amount that’s decided upon by the organization offering the money.On the other hand, equity crowdfunding allows founders to set their own funding targets. At StartEngine we rely on two different SEC Regulations, each with a different funding ceiling: Reg CF ($5M) and Reg A ($75M). This approach offers more flexibility for the average founder. Rather than cobbling together startup capital through a patchwork of grants, equity crowdfunding allows founders to focus their efforts on raising the amount they need from a single source.Consistency of FundingA staggering 82% of small business failures come from cash flow problems. Of course, cash flow doesn’t just mean the quantity coming in—it also means the rate at which the money flows. If your small business is struggling with cash flow in its early stages, it can be tricky to rely on small business grants. With little consistency in their deadlines for applications, payout procedures and seasonality, even if you manage to win a small business grant, the money might not come when you need it most.Most importantly, a grant is a one-off payment, and if you want more money, you need to draft and submit more applications. Equity crowdfunding, on the other hand, allows startups to continue raising funds through multiple rounds, building momentum—and a loyal community of investor-advocates—without constantly putting resources towards reassessing your eligibility for small business grants. Of course, equity crowdfunding isn’t instantaneous, either—a StartEngine raise can take from 90 days to one year to reach its funding goal.TransparencyWhile many small business grants are targeted toward underrepresented communities or businesses facing hardship, they still suffer from a lack of transparency. Small business grants are often gatekept by institutions with opaque, sometimes arbitrary decision-making processes, whereas equity crowdfunding is open to everyone. Rather than satisfy a panel of judges or board members to win a grant, with StartEngine, you can raise funds from a diverse pool of investors and build enthusiasm at the same time.Which Option is Right for Me?Small business grants and equity crowdfunding both offer distinct advantages and disadvantages that, depending on your business, can make one or the other the better choice for you. Let’s talk pros and cons.Advantages of Small Business GrantsYou Don’t Have to Repay them: When you receive a grant, you don’t have to offer equity or repay the moneyThe “Waterfall Effect”: Winning one small business grant builds your credibility in the community and makes it easier to get more grants going forwardDisadvantages of Small Business GrantsCompetitive and Time-Consuming: Applying for small business grants can involve mountains of paperwork, and sometimes you’ll be competing with hundreds of businesses who’ve applied to same grant—meaning that grant applications may not offer the best reward on your time investmentNot Transparent: The decision-making behind grant awards can be opaque and arbitrary, and you can’t be sure that the awarding body is looking at the true potential of your companyStrings Attached: While grant money doesn’t have to be repaid, it can come with strings attached, such as government oversight, audits or time-consuming reportingLess Visibility: While small business grants may help you build credibility within the insular world of nonprofits and organizations that offer small business grants, a successful equity crowdfunding campaign wins exposure and builds excitement among thousands of peopleWhy Equity Crowdfunding?At StartEngine, we believe that equity crowdfunding is the superior choice for many founders.

That means that if you’re the founder of an early-stage business, funding is on your mind—and if it’s not, it should be.&nbsp;</p><p>Many entrepreneurs turn to small business grants to help them raise funds in the early days of getting their business off the ground. Small business grants can come from nonprofit organizations, private companies or federal or state agencies, and don’t have to be repaid. But out of all your<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/8024420/Founders%20Guide%20eBook.pdf\">options</a>, are they the best way to fund a new business? Let’s break down the pros and cons of small business grants, as well as some alternatives—<a href=\"https://www.startengine.com/how-it-works?utm_content=equity_crowdfunding_page\">like equity crowdfunding</a>—to see which option is right for you.</p><p><strong>What are Small Business Grants?</strong></p><p>Small business grants are grants awarded to startups or established businesses. They can be given out by federal or state agencies, as well as nonprofits and private companies. They’re often targeted towards specific types of businesses, such as those owned by minorities or women, or, more recently, ones affected by the COVID-19 pandemic like restaurants, music venues or bars. Like angel investors, crowdfunding, small business loans and friends and family rounds, small business grants are one possible source of funding for your early-stage business.</p><p>Small business grants are sometimes described as “free money,” which can be true—there’s generally no expectation that you’ll repay them, and they can offer the opportunity to grow your business at your discretion, without the pressure that comes with a loan or an investment. Too good to be true? Maybe.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Grants often come with strings attached</strong>, and the application process can be time-consuming, especially when you consider the actual dollar amount of the grant.</p><p><strong>What is Equity Crowdfunding</strong></p><p>Another option for small business is<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href=\"https://www.startengine.com/equity-crowdfunding\">equity crowdfunding</a></strong>. Equity crowdfunding is the process of sourcing early-stage funding from small investors in exchange for equity in your company through a platform like StartEngine. The number of small businesses raising startup funds through equity crowdfunding has exploded since 2020, as venture capital deals dropped by more than 40% due to COVID-19. So what are the key differences between equity crowdfunding and small business grants?</p><p><strong>Amount of Funds</strong></p><p>Estimates of the average start-up capital required by small business owners vary: the Wells Fargo Small Business Index Study<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/2014_Finance_FAQ.pdf\">found</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that the average owner uses about $10,000 of startup capital, while the Kauffman Firm Survey, consisting of mostly high-tech firms, put that number at $80,000 each year.</p><p>The amount of money you’ll need to raise to get your business off the ground depends on a variety of factors, including your business plan, your anticipated profits and your overhead. Small business grants can be as small as $1,000 or as large as $100,000 or more, though you’re unlikely to reach the upper end of that range unless you’re an established company facing hardship.

That means delivering the most concise, compact version of your pitch there is. In that time, you need to convey what your company is about, how it works, and what the investment opportunity is. As Mr. Wonderful says, “Explain it to me so I understand it right away.” If you can’t do that in 90 seconds, you may lose the investor’s attention.Market YourselfMr. Wonderful wants to know why you and your co-founders are the best people out there to execute your idea. In addition to establishing your credentials, don’t shy away from sharing details that could convince an investor to fund your idea. “Is it in your family? Did you try [to start a business] before and you’ve learned from your failure?” Mr. Wonderful has asked in the past.Give investors reason to believe in you specifically, that you are more qualified than anyone else to build your idea, that you care more than anyone else about the specific problem you are working to solve.Have Your Research at the ReadyKnow your numbers, as Mr. Wonderful likes to say. Beyond knowing your own business, you should demonstrate that you know the industry like the back of your hand. Come prepared with data: on the size of your industry, who the competition is, your revenue, how much it costs to make your product, and where you might widen your margins.Mr. Wonderful also advises that you research your investor: “Know everything about the business people to whom you’re pitching. Get the prospectus; read the website; Google the hell out of them. You can’t simply wing it in the Tank, or in the boardroom.”Keep Gimmicks to a MinimumAlthough you should strive to present your pitch in a creative way, when it comes to props, less is more, says Mr. Wonderful. “There’s a big difference between a solid pitch that happens to dazzle, and one that needs to dazzle to hide its lack of substance,” he explains. “Less is usually more. If yours is a good idea, it won’t need bells and whistles to make the grade.”Now that you know how to perfect your pitch, are you ready to pitch your business to a live audience?StartEngine’s quarterly live pitch competition returns this October, giving founders the opportunity to pitch their startup to Mr. Wonderful himself.

It can also provide you with a means of comparing a company’s performance to other companies in the same industry and stage of growth.&nbsp;</p><p>To make it easier for you to accomplish this, we have outlined some key terms and financial concepts to make it easier for you to review and understand a startup’s financial statements.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Note: a typical set of financial statements will include a balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, statement of shareholder equity, and supplement notes.&nbsp;</em></p><h2><strong>Income and Expenses</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>At some point in its lifecycle, a company must generate a sufficient amount of income to survive and grow (otherwise, it will continue to need outside sources of funding). So, how can you tell how much money a company is making, and how much it is spending? To determine this, you’ll need to take a look at the company’s<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-the-income-statement\">Income Statement</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(for Regulation Crowdfunding’s offering details) or their “Statement of Operations” (for Regulation A+’s offering circular).</p><h3>Gross Revenue</h3><p>The first item presented on a company’s income statement is<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-are-revenues\">Gross Revenue</a>. This is the amount of money the company has received by selling its goods and/or services. It is reported on the first line of the income statement, which is why you may come across people refer to gross revenue as “top line revenue” or simply “revenue.”</p><h3>Cost of Goods Sold</h3><p>After revenue, a company will deduct<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/cost-of-goods-sold-cogs/\">Cost of Goods Sold</a>. This can also be called “Cost of Revenue” or “Cost of Services” and refers to all expenses that are directly related to the production of whatever products a company is selling or services it is performing. Sometimes a company may not have these costs on its income statement if it is an early stage pre-revenue startup that has not introduced its product/services to the market. These are also referred to as “variable costs” because they typically rise and fall in line with sales—simply put, producing more costs more.</p><h3>Gross Profit</h3><p>Once these costs are deducted, the resulting number is the company’s<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226158\">Gross Profit</a>—the amount of money earned from the product or service sold. It is called a “Gross Loss,” if the sale of product or service loses money. In financial documents, losses are indicated by numbers in parenthesis, so for example ($200,000) would represent a loss of $200,000.</p><h3>Operating Expenses</h3><p><a href=\"https://bench.co/blog/accounting/operating-expenses/\">Operating Expenses</a>, such as research and development expenses (money spent on innovation and technological advancement), “General and Administrative” expenses (day-to-day costs such as accounting, legal, utilities and rent) and many others are&nbsp; deducted from gross profit or added to gross loss. These consist of all costs that are not directly attributable to the production of a product and/or service and are generally considered “fixed” costs because they do not rise or fall directly in line with sales.</p><h3>Operating Profit/Loss</h3><p>After considering these expenses, the resulting figure (gross profit minus operating expenses) is known as<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.business-literacy.com/financial-concepts/ebit-operating-profit/\">Operating Profit</a>, or Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). It is considered an “Operating Loss” or “Loss from Operations” when gross profit minus operating expenses results in a negative value.&nbsp;</p><h3>Net Income</h3><p>Once interest expense on outstanding debt and income taxes are deducted from Operating Profit/Loss, you arrive at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/n/net-income/\">Net Income</a>. Conversely, if after deducting taxes and interest paid on the company’s debt results in a negative amount, it’s called a “Net Loss.”</p><p>This figure is referred to as a company’s “bottom line” due to the fact that it is typically the last item presented on the company’s income statement—much in the same way gross revenue is referred to as a company’s top line. Also, people will many times address a company’s net income or net loss as a percent of revenue, known as its “net profit margin,” which is used to measure a company’s overall profitability.</p><p>In the context of investing in startups, it’s worth noting that most companies will record gross losses, operating losses and net losses. Nearly all early-stage businesses are not profitable as funds are reinvested into growth and R&amp;D. It’s why startups raise funding: to build the product that they can sell, to scale their operations to reach an economy of scale, to hire new employees, and a host of other reasons that help them grow towards that point of generating profit.</p><h2>Net Worth: Understanding Balance Sheets</h2><p>A company’s<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/balance-sheet/\">Balance Sheet</a><span>&nbsp;</span>presents their assets (anything the company owns that has value such as cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and real estate) and liabilities (what the company owes, such as unpaid invoices, taxes and debt). When you subtract all of the funds owed by the company from all of the assets it owns, you get the overall net worth (the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-is-the-book-value-of-an-asset-398146\">book value</a><span>&nbsp;</span>of total assets minus total liabilities) of the company. Let’s start by looking at the asset side of the balance sheet.</p><h3>Current Assets</h3><p>The first category you will see is called, “<a href=\"https://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/what-is-a-current-asset\">Current Assets</a>.” These are all assets that are considered cash or assets that the company expects will be converted into cash within a year. This includes cash and cash equivalents (any asset that can be immediately turned into cash, such as foreign currencies, short term government debt securities called<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp\">Treasury Bills</a>, and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp\">certificates of deposit</a>),<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp\">accounts receivable</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(the amount of money you are owed for products and services delivered that have not been paid for),<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/inventory/guides/inventory-definition-meaning-types.html\">inventory</a>, prepaid expenses and other items.&nbsp;</p><p>Current assets are a major element of a company’s<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/smallbusiness/business-financing/learn/what-is-working-capital/\">working capital</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(current assets minus current liabilities) that presents the amount of funds available to pay off short-term or current liabilities, which we will define later. The more working capital a company has, the greater its<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.accountingcoach.com/working-capital/explanation\">liquidity</a>, which implies a more healthy financial position.</p><h3>Long Term Assets</h3><p>Next up on the balance sheet are<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/long-term-assets/\">Long Term Assets</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that consist of non-current assets that have a useful life of longer than 1 year. They include: property and equipment; long term investments; intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, trade names and goodwill; and software.</p><p>Long term assets are typically presented on the balance sheet at their cost value minus<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/accumulated-depreciation/\">accumulated depreciation</a>, which equals their net book value. Significant growth in this category can indicate that a company is focusing on or moving into or expanding lines of business that require a greater investment in fixed assets.</p><h3>Current Liabilities</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/5/current-liability\">Current Liabilities</a><span>&nbsp;</span>consist of all expenses that are payable within 1 year, or sometimes within one<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/operating-cycle/\">operating cycle</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(the time period required to receive inventory, sell it and collect cash from the sale).</p><p>These short term liabilities include<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountspayable.asp\">accounts payable</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(for example, unpaid invoices to suppliers), lines of credit, short term loans,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accruedexpense.asp\">accrued expenses</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(owed money for which no invoice has been submitted), taxes payable and payroll liabilities.</p><p>Current liabilities are also used in the calculation of working capital in order to ascertain a company’s level of liquidity as described above. This can provide important insight into the company and give you a sense of whether the company is generating enough revenue and cash in the short term to cover its bills.&nbsp;</p><h3>Long Term Liabilities</h3><p><a href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/accounting-101-basics-long-term-liability-60869.html\">Long Term Liabilities</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are made up of all obligations that are not due within 1 year of the date the balance sheet was prepared or during the company’s operating cycle. Examples of these liabilities are bonds payable, long term debt,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deferredtaxliability.asp\">deferred taxes</a>, mortgage payable and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-are-the-criteria-for-a-capital-lease.html\">capital leases</a>.</p><p>A company is over burdened by excessive long term liabilities can equate to high monthly payments and lower cash flow, but some amount of long term obligations can be positive. This is due to the advantages that a company can gain through access to long term financing at low interest rates that can help it expand over a longer time period.&nbsp;</p><h3>Net Worth</h3><p>Finally, we come to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/estimate-net-worth-company-21388.html\">Net Worth</a>, which is most often referred to as “shareholders equity.” It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and represents the amount of money a company would have if it ceased operations and paid off all of its debt. It is calculated the same way you would calculate your personal net worth—you would add the total value of everything you own then subtract all the money you owe.&nbsp;</p><p>Banks use this number as a metric for lending decisions because if a company’s assets far exceed its liabilities, it indicates a healthy financial position. On the flip side of the coin, if a company’s net worth is negative, it just means that the amount of money it owes exceeds the value of its assets. It should be noted that this is a common financial situation for an early stage startup that is trying to establish a foothold in its target market and continue to grow until its net worth is positive.</p><h2>Cash Flow</h2><p><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/statement-of-cash-flows/\">The Statement of Cash Flows</a><span>&nbsp;</span>presents the net cash flow for a company over a given time period. It shows how cash enters and leaves a company from three main activities:</p><ul><li>Operations (sales, inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable)</li><li>Investing (buying and selling of assets and equipment)</li><li>Financing (selling of bonds, stock and paying off debt)</li></ul><p>If an activity results in cash flowing into the company, it is shown as a positive number. If an activity causes cash to flow out of the company, it is shown as a negative number and placed in parentheses. E.g. $100,000 indicates a positive value, and ($100,000) indicates a negative value.</p><h3>Cash Flows From Operating Activities</h3><p><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/cash-flow-from-operations/\">Cash flows from operating activities</a><span>&nbsp;</span>equates to how much cash has been spent or received from the company’s operations. One item is net income, which supplies cash to a company, or net loss, which indicates a flow of cash out of the company.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/what-is-depreciation-expense/\">Depreciation expense</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(a yearly decrease in the value of a fixed asset over time resulting from normal wear and tear) and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp\">amortization expense</a><span>&nbsp;</span>(the yearly write-off of the value of an intangible asset over its useful life—e.g., a patent that is granted for 20 years has a 20 year useful life) are non-cash expenses subtracted from gross profit on the income statement. As such, they are added back since they are tax deductable expenses that do not deplete cash on hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes in working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) are also considered on the statement of cash flows. For example, if the company collects more cash from its receivables, cash increases. If it pays down its accounts payable, then that would reduce the amount of cash the company has on hand.&nbsp;</p><h3>Investing Activities</h3><p>Cash used for investing activities include cash spent on long term assets such as real estate, equipment (also called “<a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/capital-expenditures/\">capital expenditures</a>”), patents, stocks and bonds. Conversely, gains on the sale of long term assets are recorded as cash received by the company. For example, if a company sold a warehouse, that would indicate a positive cash flow, whereas the purchase of stock in another company would constitute a negative cash flow.</p><h3>Financing Activities</h3><p>Finally, if a company raises money from investors by issuing securities such as convertible notes or stock, this would result in a positive cash flow to the company. When the company makes payments on its debts or buys back shares, it results in a negative cash flow.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>And when all cash inflows and outflows are considered, the resulting amount of cash left over is a company’s net cash position. If a company shows an overall negative cash flow over time, the rate at which it is spending its cash reserves is known as its<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/modeling/burn-rate/\">burn rate</a>. The burn rate is usually quoted in terms of cash spent per month.<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.priceintelligently.com/blog/burn-rate\">82% of startups fail</a><span>&nbsp;</span>due to the lack of cash flow necessary to survive and grow.</p><p>Based on the burn rate, you can figure out the company’s<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.rapptrlabs.com/academy/how-to-calculate-your-startup-funding-runway\">runway</a>, which tells you how long a startup can survive before it will need to earn positive cash flow or raise additional capital (if the company’s finances remain unchanged). A startup’s runway is equal to its total cash reserves divided by its burn rate.</p><p>Understanding a company’s financials can help you make a more educated and informed decision when choosing the right startup to invest in. Once you have a good idea of what all of the terms mean, financial information will become easier to understand and faster to review, and in turn, investing on StartEngine will become a more enjoyable experience.</p><p><br></p>", "header_image": "9e67f179-10c6-420a-b7f7-71a63dfa1942", "post_status": "publish", "comment_status": "open", "tags": null, "slug": "how-to-read-a-startups-financial-statements"}}, {"model": "learning_board.event", "pk": 1, "fields": {"title": "Satellites and Defense Solutions, the conflict in Ukraine", "excerpt": "From GPS, television, cell service, weather monitoring, all the way to financial transactions - satellite technology is vital to modern, connected life.
